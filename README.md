# Angular-Seed-for-Small-Projects
A simple angularJS seed app.

This angularJS seed aims to be a starting point for future projects. This also serves
as an example for introducing the new 'component' approach to angularJS.

Update:
I've updated the project to reflect the new component approach for building apps. I've also
added a package.json to make it easier to get started.

You can clone the project and then install dependencies with:
npm install

To start the seed cd to its root directory and run:
lite-server

---------------------------------------------

This was honestly created out of need for myself to try and remove the hassle of
prototyping and testing random things within Angular, as well as to save time when starting
relatively small projects.
