# Angular-Seed-for-Small-Projects
A simple angularJS seed app.

This angularJS seed aims to be a starting point for future projects. This also serves
as an example for introducing the new 'component' approach to angularJS.

A component will generally consist of a Controller, Directive with a template, and a Service (if it's relevant)


---------------------------------------------

This was honestly created out of need for myself to try and remove the hassle of
prototyping and testing random things within Angular, as well as to save time when starting
relatively small projects.
